# Every client likes charts, but deployment is hard

- I want to show some visualization to people without any prior Python or R installation
- It should be super quick to deploy without any licensing or right's request
- It should not break my programming workflow, i.e. fully automated

# Many solutions, but none is perfect (and so is mine)

> - Tableau: Licensing fees ðŸ’¸ and need another data scientist to do the update/upload
> - PowerBI: of course we don't have the best feature, namely Python and R integration, and still no other data scientist to do the update/upload
> - Shiny, Dash,...: Very powerful but will take a while to figure out how to setup (how to securely expose an app)
> - other platforms: potentially client data restrictions or some complicated IT setup required
> - using Javascript framework(s): was it vue.js, node.js, angular.js, or react.js?

# Many solutions, but none is perfect (and so is mine)

> - some other way to run your workspace as server through shared folder

# My needs are simple
- Most of the time the use case requires to display a dashboard with some graphics which can be interactively engaged with, such as filtering by selection
- My goal is to create a flat html which embeds the all data and renders the visualization
- The proposed options are R packages but, surely there are some Python equivalents for certain features (as some packages are Javascript wrappers)
